Building on needle's autograd and tensor computation engine, we will add optimizers such as AdamW, RMSProp, Adagrad, LAMB and AdaBelief, supporting both dense and sparse parameter udpates. Each optimizer will be designed as a modular, extensible class fully compatible with Needle's computation grpah and device abstraction. We will reference key research papers including Loschilov & Hutter (2019) for AdamW, you et al. (2020) for LAMB and Zhuang et al. (2020) for AdaBelief. Our evaluation will include convergence speed, trianing stability and scalability benchamrks on standard datasets (CIFAR-10), demonstrating quantitative improvements in optimization performance within the Needle framework.\n","\n","To strengthen it, you could briefly describe the planned optimizer API (how users switch optimizers, handle hyper-parameters, and sparse updates) and spell out the key evaluation plots you expect to show (e.g., loss/accuracy vs. steps and wall-clock time). // Rewrite this part\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","# Content\n","- **Section 1:** Initial pre-setup | Includes cloning of repository\n","- **Section 2:** Pre-test | Ensuring that `RestNet9` and `Cifar10` implementations are correct\n","- **Section 3:** API Optimization and Configuration Setup | Explanation on how we have engineered an efficient way to perform ablation testing\n","- **Section 4:** Optimizers\n","- **Section 5:** Final Thoughts\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","# Section 1: Initial pre-setup"],"metadata":{"id":"Xwi3e4N3Iba3"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9832,"status":"ok","timestamp":1763051672713,"user":{"displayName":"Royce Ang","userId":"01449776374177748390"},"user_tz":300},"id":"e-cSvxKx9eJ9","outputId":"c9922956-4e58-4158-f02a-e047352c25e9"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["GitHub PAT (read-only): ··········\n"]}],"source":["# Enter the private github token provided via 1password\n","import os, getpass\n","os.environ[\"GITHUB_TOKEN\"] = getpass.getpass(\"GitHub PAT (read-only): \")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4o5_dC9U9WXR","outputId":"7bb2d991-5606-4d76-e813-c9be3b11c1bd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763051684314,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":9024,"user":{"displayName":"Royce Ang","userId":"01449776374177748390"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n","/content/drive/MyDrive\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/10714\n","fatal: destination path '10714-dlsys-final-project-group-43' already exists and is not an empty directory.\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/10714/10714-dlsys-final-project-group-43\n","Requirement already satisfied: pybind11 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (3.0.1)\n","Collecting git+https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git\n","  Cloning https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git to /tmp/pip-req-build-kjy1bhz8\n","  Running command git clone --filter=blob:none --quiet https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git /tmp/pip-req-build-kjy1bhz8\n","  Resolved https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git to commit ac73f725eb2ce0e2c6a38fa540035ee970b8b873\n","  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/\n","!mkdir -p 10714\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/10714\n","# !git clone --branch <branch-name> --single-branch https://$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/royc0003/10714-dlsys-final-project-group-43.git\n","# !git clone https://$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/royc0003/10714-dlsys-final-project-group-43.git\n","!git clone --branch optim_strat --single-branch https://$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/royc0003/10714-dlsys-final-project-group-43.git\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/10714/10714-dlsys-final-project-group-43\n","!pip3 install pybind11\n","!pip3 install --upgrade --no-deps git+https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git\n","#del os.environ[\"GITHUB_TOKEN\"]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3378,"status":"ok","timestamp":1763051691985,"user":{"displayName":"Royce Ang","userId":"01449776374177748390"},"user_tz":300},"id":"LvxduRoJ9srx","outputId":"13a286cd-9bbe-48bf-8a03-58efb45072fd"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[0mCMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):\n","  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of\n","  CMake.\n","\n","  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.

The gradients of the two operations can be written in terms of each other. We do not directly test `Split`, and only test the backward pass of `Stack` (for which we assume you used `Split`).\n","\n","**Note:** You may want to make your Summation op support sums over multiple axes; you will likely need it for the backward pass of the BroadcastTo op if yours supports broadcasting over multiple axes at a time. However, this is more about ease of use than necessity, and we leave this decision up to you (there are no corresponding tests).\n","\n","**Note:** Depending on your implementations, you may want to ensure that you call `.compact()` before reshaping arrays.

We will try to provide some useful hints here. Basically, we encourage you to make use of the surprising fact that _whatever makes the dimensions work out is typically right_.\n","\n","Ultimately, the backward pass of convolution can be done in terms of the convolution operator itself, with some clever manipulations using `flip`, `dilate`, and multiple applications of `transpose` to both the arguments and the results.\n","\n","In the last section, we essentially implemented convolution as a matrix product: ignoring the various restride and reshape operations, we basically have something like `X @ W`, where `X` is the input and `W` is the weight. We also have `out_grad`, which is the same shape as `X @ W`. Now, you have already implemented the backward pass of matrix multiplication in a previous assignment, and we can use this knowledge to get some insight into the backward pass of convolution. In particular, referencing your matmul backward implementation, you may notice (heuristically speaking here):\n","\n","`X.grad = out_grad @ W.transpose` \\\n","`W.grad = X.transpose @ out_grad`\n","\n","Surprisingly enough, things work out if we just assume that these are also convolutions (and now assuming that `out_grad`, `W`, and `X` are tensors amenable to 2D multi-channel convolution instead of matrices):\n","\n","`X.grad = ≈conv(≈out_grad, ≈W)` \\\n","`W.grad = ≈conv(≈X, ≈out_grad)`\n","\n","In which the \"≈\" indicates that you need to apply some additional operators to these terms in order to get the dimensions to work out, such as permuting/transposing axes, dilating, changing the `padding=` argument to the convolution function, or permuting/transposing axes of the resulting convolution.\n","\n","As we saw on the [last few slides here](https://dlsyscourse.org/slides/conv_nets.pdf) in class, the transpose of a convolution can be found by simply flipping the kernel. Since we're working in 2D instead of 1D, this means flipping the kernel both vertically and horizontally (thus why we implemented `flip`).\n","\n","Summarizing some hints for both `X.grad` and `W.grad`:\n","\n","`X.grad`\n","- The convolution of `out_grad` and `W`, with some operations applied to those\n","- `W` should be flipped over both the kernel dimensions\n","- If the convolution is strided, increase the size of `out_grad` with a corresponding dilation\n","- Do an example to analyze dimensions: note the shape you want for `X.grad`, and think about how you must permute/transpose the arguments and add padding to the convolution to achieve this shape\n","    - This padding depends on both the kernel size and the `padding` argument to the convolution\n","\n","`W.grad`\n","- The convolution of `X` and `out_grad`, with some operations applied to those\n","- The gradients of `W` must be accumulated over the batches; how can you make the conv operator itself do this accumulation?\n","    - Consider turning batches into channels via transpose/permute\n","- Analyze dimensions: how can you modify `X` and `out_grad` so that the shape of their convolution matches the shape of `W`? You may need to transpose/permute the result.\n","    - Remember to account for the `padding` argument passed to convolution\n","\n","General tips\n","- Deal with strided convolutions last (you should be able to just drop in `dilate` when you've passed most of the tests)\n","- Start with the case where `padding=0`, then consider changing `padding` arguments\n","- You can \"permute\" axes with multiple calls to `transpose`\n","\n","It might also be useful to skip ahead to nn.Conv, pass the forward tests, and then use both the tests below and the nn.Conv backward tests to debug your

probability of the next word in the sequence, based on the words already observed in the sequence. You will write support for the Penn Treebank dataset, which consists of stories from the Wall Street Journal, to train and evaluate a language model on word-level prediction.\n","\n","In `python/needle/data/datasets/ptb_dataset.py`, start by implementing the `Dictionary` class, which creates a dictionary from a list of words, mapping each word to a unique integer.\n","\n","Next, we will use this `Dictionary` class to create a corpus from the train and test txt files in the Penn Treebank dataset that you downloaded at the beginning of the notebook. Implement the `tokenize` function in the `Corpus` class to do this.\n","\n","In order to prepare the data for training and evaluation, you will next implement the `batchify` function. Starting from sequential data, batchify arranges the dataset into columns. For instance, with the alphabet as the sequence and batch size 4, we'd get\n","\n","```\n","┌ a g m s ┐\n","│ b h n t │\n","│ c i o u │\n","│ d j p v │\n","│ e k q w │\n","└ f l r x ┘\n","```\n","\n","These columns are treated as independent by the model, which means that the dependence of e. g. 'g' on 'f' cannot be learned, but allows more efficient batch processing.\n","\n","Next, implement the `get_batch` function. `get_batch` subdivides the source data into chunks of length `bptt`. If source is equal to the example output of the batchify function, with a bptt-limit of 2, we'd get the following two `Tensor`s for i = 0:\n","```\n","┌ a g m s ┐ ┌ b h n t ┐\n","└ b h n t ┘ └ c i o u ┘\n","```\n","Note that despite the name of the function, the subdivison of data is not done along the batch dimension (i.e. dimension 1), since that was handled by the batchify function. The chunks are along dimension 0, corresponding to the seq_len dimension in the LSTM or RNN. Also, as per the function docs, the second returned `Tensor` (the targets) should be reshaped to be 1-dimensional."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":18716,"status":"ok","timestamp":1762736559343,"user":{"displayName":"Royce
